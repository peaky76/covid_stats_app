# UK COVID-19 Stats App

The BBC has asked you to create an app which displays the latest COVID-19 statistics on the pandemic for various locations around the country. It will be used by local news teams to produce reports for broadcast and will also be used by the general public to check the current situation in their local area.

## MVP

- Allow the user to search COVID-19 stats by local authority, region or nation.
- The user should be able to filter the results by cases, hospital admissions and deaths.
- The user should be able to specify a date range for their searches.
- The data should be presented to the user in a meaningful visual form, such as a bar chart or pie chart.

## Extensions:

- The user should be able to compare stats between different locations over time.
- The user should be able to save searches for quick reference.
- Allow users to track their symptoms
- Display a UK map with COVID-19 hotspots
- Display Twitter updates from WHO and other relevant information providers
